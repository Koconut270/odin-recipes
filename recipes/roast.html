    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 pounds boneless chuck roast</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add oil, then sear meat in the center of the pan for 4 minutes. Turn meat over with tongs; sear for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove meat from the pot.</li>
        <li>Arrange onion, garlic, and 1 bay leaf in the bottom of the pan; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Return meat to the pan, place remaining bay leaf on top of meat, and cover.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue cooking until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer roast to a platter and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Slice and top with onions and gravy.</li>

    </ol>
