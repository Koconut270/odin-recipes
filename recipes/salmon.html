    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Fresh ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Whole	(8 oz) salmon fillets</li>
        <li>2 Cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Grand Marnier</li>
        <li>1 Pinch	Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a small bowl, combine the fresh ground pepper and sugar, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, add the balsamic vinegar and bring to a low boil.
             Adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer and reduce the balsamic vinegar until it resembles a syrup, 
             or until it can coat the back of a spoon, 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the glaze from the heat and let it cool. Add the Grand Marnier and pinch of salt, to taste.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, set the Traeger temperature to 450°F and preheat with the lid closed for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season the salmon evenly with the pepper and sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Insert the probe horizontally into the center of the fish filet. Place flesh-side-down, directly on the grill grates.
             Close the lid, and sear for 5 minutes. Turn the fish over and cook until desired doneness or the internal temperature
             reaches 145°F, 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the filets from the grill. Drizzle with balsamic glaze and serve warm. Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
